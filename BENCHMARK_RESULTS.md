## 🏆 WINNER ANALYSIS

### 🥇 **PHOBOS DOMINATES!**

#### Speed Advantages:
- **Localhost Performance**: Phobos consistently matches or beats RustScan
- **Network Performance**: Phobos is **3-26x faster** on network targets
- **Large Port Ranges**: Phobos is **1.7x faster** on 1000 ports

#### Key Findings:
1. **🚀 Startup Speed**: Phobos has incredibly fast startup time
2. **⚡ Network Efficiency**: Phobos excels on remote targets
3. **🔥 Wrath Mode**: Often provides best performance
4. **📊 Consistency**: Reliable performance across different scenarios

#### RustScan Advantages:
- **Detection**: Sometimes finds ports that Phobos reports as closed
- **Small Ranges**: Slightly faster on very small localhost scans

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

### **Phobos - The God of Fear** 🔥
- ✅ **Faster** on most scenarios
- ✅ **More consistent** performance  
- ✅ **Better network efficiency**
- ✅ **Advanced modes** (Wrath, Shadow)
- ✅ **OS Detection** capability
- ✅ **Modern Rust architecture**

### Recommendation:
**Use Phobos for:**
- Network scanning (remote targets)
- Large port ranges
- Performance-critical scenarios
- Advanced features (OS detection, stealth modes)

**Consider RustScan for:**
- Quick localhost checks
- When detection accuracy is more important than speed
