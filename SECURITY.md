7. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
8. **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### Example Report Format

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Buffer overflow in port parsing

Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
Component: Port range parser (src/utils/port_parser.rs)
Version: v1.1.1
Severity: High

Description:
When parsing malformed port ranges, the application reads beyond 
allocated buffer boundaries, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run: phobos target.com -p "1-9999999999999999"
2. Observe: Segmentation fault

Impact:
Attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with scanner privileges.

Proof of Concept:
[Attach exploit code or detailed steps]

Suggested Fix:
Add bounds checking in parse_port_range() function before allocation.

Contact: your-email@example.com
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Running Phobos Safely

1. **Use Minimum Required Privileges**
   ```bash
   # For TCP connect scans (no root needed)
   phobos target.com -p 80,443
   
   # For SYN scans (requires root/sudo)
   sudo phobos target.com -s syn -p 80,443
   ```

2. **Isolate Network Scanning**
   - Run in isolated networks when possible
   - Use VMs or containers for untrusted targets
   - Be aware of your network traffic

3. **Validate Input Files**
   ```bash
   # Always verify target lists before scanning
   cat targets.txt
   phobos -i targets.txt
   ```

4. **Secure Configuration Files**
   ```bash
   # Protect config files with sensitive data
   chmod 600 ~/.config/phobos/config.toml
   ```

5. **Update Regularly**
   ```bash
   # Check for updates frequently
   phobos --update
   
   # Or rebuild from source
   git pull origin main
   cargo build --release
   ```

#### Permissions

- **TCP Connect Scan**: No special permissions required ‚úÖ
- **SYN Scan**: Requires `CAP_NET_RAW` or root privileges ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Raw Socket Operations**: Requires elevated privileges ‚ö†Ô∏è

```bash
# Grant capabilities instead of running as root (Linux)
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/local/bin/phobos

# Now can run SYN scans without sudo
phobos target.com -s syn
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   ```rust
   // Always validate and sanitize user input
   fn parse_target(target: &str) -> Result<IpAddr> {
       if target.len() > MAX_TARGET_LENGTH {
           return Err(Error::InvalidInput);
       }
       // Additional validation...
   }
   ```

2. **Bounds Checking**
   ```rust
   // Use safe indexing
   let port = ports.get(index).ok_or(Error::IndexOutOfBounds)?;
   
   // Avoid: ports[index]  // Can panic!
   ```

3. **Resource Limits**
   ```rust
   // Limit resource consumption
   const MAX_PORTS: usize = 65535;
   const MAX_TARGETS: usize = 1000;
   const MAX_BATCH_SIZE: usize = 15000;
   ```

4. **Memory Safety**
   ```rust
   // Leverage Rust's ownership system
   // Use Arc/Mutex for shared state
   // Avoid unsafe blocks unless absolutely necessary
   ```

5. **Dependency Auditing**
   ```bash
   # Regularly audit dependencies
   cargo audit
   cargo outdated
   ```

#### Script Execution Security

When executing custom scripts:

1. **Sandbox Execution**
   - Scripts run in isolated environment
   - Limited system access
   - Timeout enforcement

2. **Script Validation**
   ```bash
   # Validate scripts before execution
   phobos target.com --scripts custom --script-dir ./scripts
   ```

3. **Resource Limits**
   - CPU time limits
   - Memory limits
   - Network access restrictions

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### 1. Raw Socket Access

**Issue**: SYN scanning requires raw socket access (elevated privileges)

**Risk**: If compromised, attacker gains network-level access

**Mitigation**:
- Use TCP connect scan when possible (no special privileges)
- Use capability-based permissions instead of root
- Run in containers/VMs for isolation

### 2. GPU Memory Access

**Issue**: GPU acceleration accesses device memory directly

**Risk**: Potential information leakage from GPU memory

**Mitigation**:
- GPU memory is zeroed before use
- Results are cleared after transfer
- Use separate GPU for sensitive scans if concerned

### 3. Denial of Service

**Issue**: Aggressive scanning can impact target systems

**Risk**: Unintentional DoS of target services

**Mitigation**:
- Use appropriate timing profiles (`-T 0-3` for production)
- Implement rate limiting (`--rate-limit`)
- Test in controlled environments first

### 4. Network Fingerprinting

**Issue**: Scanning patterns can be detected and blocked

**Risk**: Scanner identification and IP blocking

**Mitigation**:
- Use stealth modes (`--stealth`, `--shadow`)
- Randomize scan order (`--scan-order random`)
- Use decoy scanning (`-D`)

### 5. Script Injection

**Issue**: Custom scripts could contain malicious code

**Risk**: Code execution on scanner system

**Mitigation**:
- Scripts run in sandboxed environment
- Limited system access
- Review custom scripts before use

## üîç Security Auditing

### Self-Audit Checklist

- [ ] Input validation on all user-supplied data
- [ ] Bounds checking on array accesses
- [ ] Resource limit enforcement
- [ ] No unsafe blocks without justification
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and audited
- [ ] Secrets are not hardcoded
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Logging doesn't include sensitive data

### Automated Security Checks

```bash
# Run security audit
cargo audit

# Check for unsafe code
cargo geiger

# Run clippy with security lints
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all -W clippy::pedantic

# Dependency license check
cargo deny check

# Static analysis
cargo semver-checks
```
